# Technical Interview Practice on Data Structure and Code Efficiency

August 2017, by Jude Moon

## Practice Overview

For this practice, I tried to answer [five technical interviewing questions](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd002/parts/19280355-b835-4ce4-b867-2c2e2e85d0a0/modules/07cc5d99-f81d-45df-af3b-9206dca1739d/lessons/7736707697239847/concepts/78912813390923) on a variety of topics discussed in the technical interviewing course. I have written the answers using Python code, as well as the explanations of the efficiency of the code and the design choices.
